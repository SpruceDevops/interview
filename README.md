### Problem
Gitlab does not start using the existing docker-compose file. 

### Goal
Fix any problems that exist and get Gitlab online. You know this is working if after running `docker-compose up -d` you can navigate to the Gitlab service (usually localhost:80) and see the login page. 

### Deliverables
Your public git repo url with working docker compose project and all dependencies. If you can't fix all the problems, share what you were able to get working. 

### Constraints
Must use the Sprucefinance public docker images 

### Hints
1. There are no problems in the conf.env file
2. Required modifications should be relatively small

### Suggested First Steps
1. If you don't already, download and install docker onto your computer
2. If you're unfamiliar with Docker, go through their "Getting Started" guide
3. Fork this repo to start with your solution
